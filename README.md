transTide is a low order model to compute the unsteady flow and loads acting on tidal turbine blades.

Updated to object oriented environement in June 2021.

Developed by Gabriel Thomas Scarlett August 2017 in support of a PhD in Unsteady hydrodynamics of tidal turbine blades, undertaken at The University of Edinburgh.
Further information on the theory and model development can be found in my thesis: https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/36125

NOTE: 
Angles are in radians, ALWAYS!
This code will NOT work with versions of MATLAB earlier than R2016b. 
No toolboxes are required.


Naming convention:
classes:   Name begins with an upper case letter (all alphabetic).
functions: Name begins with a lower case letter (all alphabetic).
scripts:   Name begins with a lower case letter and must contain an underscore.
