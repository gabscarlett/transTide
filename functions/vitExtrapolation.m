% VITERNA EXTRAPOLATION METHOD

% Function to extend lift and drag coefficients through full 360 degree

% Inputs
% aoa - angle of attack
% Cl_nd 2d or 2d Cl values in given - angle of attack range
% Cd_nd 2d or 2d Cd values in given - angle of attack range

% Outputs
% Alpha - in range -pi to pi
% Cl_360 2d or 2d Cl values in Alpha range
% Cd_360 2d or 2d Cd values in Alpha range
